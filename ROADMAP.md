## Implementation Notes

### Vision System

For the vision system, we'll focus on:

1. **Model Selection**: Using lightweight models suited for RTX 4070 Super
   - Microsoft's GIT or BLIP2 for image captioning
   - YOLOv8 for object detection
   - DeepFace or FaceNet for face recognition

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batch processing for better GPU utilization
   - Selective frame analysis (not processing every frame)
   - Resolution scaling for better performance

3. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Local processing of all vision data
   - Option to disable or limit vision recording
   - Clear visual indicators when camera is active

### Memory System Enhancements

1. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Chunking strategies for efficient retrieval
   - Vector compression techniques
   - Hybrid retrieval (keyword + semantic)

2. **Storage Efficiency**:
   - Periodic pruning of low-importance memories
   - Archiving older memories
   - Memory consolidation through summarization

3. **Cross-modal Memory**:
   - Linking visual memories with conversational context
   - Audio-visual memory integration
   - Action-outcome associations

## Hardware Considerations

The development roadmap takes into account the current hardware:

- **GPU**: RTX 4070 Super (optimized for efficiency)
