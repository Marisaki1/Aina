The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\n\nA target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.

  "❌ Can't Think or Strategize – If you tell it to “steal that key,” it might grab the key but won’t hide, sneak, or avoid detection.\n❌ Obvious Floating Object – People will notice when a bag of gold mysteriously floats away unless you're very sneaky.\n❌ No Pickpocketing – Since it’s not intelligent, it can’t steal directly from someone’s person without them noticing.\n❌ 60-Foot Range – If you move too far, the servant disappears, dropping whatever it was holding.\n❌ Only Simple Commands – It won’t react to sudden changes (e.g., guards noticing or someone grabbing the item back).",
  "What it can steal\n✅ An unattended object (e.g., a coin pouch on a table, a loose key on a shelf).\n✅ Lightweight (≤ 10 lbs).\n✅ Not inside a locked or closed container (it can't open locked chests).\n✅ Not something requiring dexterity or finesse (e.g., it can't pickpocket).",

  "🛒 Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Heist\n1️⃣ Distraction Tactic\n\nOne player engages the shopkeeper in conversation, causing them to look away.\nOptions: Ask a lot of questions, pretend to be confused, cause a small commotion.\n2️⃣ Unseen Servant in Action\n\nThe Unseen Servant moves to grab an item from the stall.\nBest Targets: Small objects like potions, scrolls, gold pouches, or a dagger.\nAvoid Heavy or Secured Items: If it’s locked, tied, or too big, it won’t work.\n3️⃣ Escape Plan\n\nThe Unseen Servant needs to move the item somewhere safe, like:\n✅ Behind a barrel or crate for later retrieval.\n✅ Into your open bag or cloak (if the DM allows).\n✅ Just outside the stall where a third person can grab it.\n⚠️ Potential Risks\n❌ Shopkeepers Aren’t Stupid – If an item disappears before their eyes, they’ll get suspicious fast.\n❌ Floating Objects Are Suspicious – If the Unseen Servant isn’t careful, the item may visibly move, alerting others.\n❌ Perception Checks – The DM might make the shopkeeper roll Perception (Wisdom) to notice something is off.\n❌ Guards & Anti-Theft Measures – Some shops have guards, alarm spells, or even familiars watching.\n❌ Unseen Servant is NOT a Rogue – It won’t sneak, so if the movement is obvious, someone will notice.",

Apparently she works hard to cultivate the crops one at a time, and this power is limited to just plants that bear in the autumn. She's called to the Human Village as a special guest at the harvest festival every year. If she is not called for before the harvest, she is not able to guarantee an abundant harvest, but that's not her problem, and she would not point it out.\n\nFrom the view of the residents of Gensokyo, the ability to make crops have an abundant harvest is a god-like power, and at looking at how she is called to the harvest festival every year, it can be considered that among gods, she considerably close and intimate to humans.",

  "Homebrew Background: Autumn’s Blessing (Inspired by Minoriko Aki)\nYou are a being of harvest and abundance, embodying the changing seasons and the gifts of nature. Wherever you go, crops grow richer, and the weary find warmth in your presence. While many overlook your existence, those who understand the cycle of nature recognize your importance. Your power is subtle but ever-present, manifesting in both moments of peace and times of battle.\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Nature, Persuasion\nTool Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit\nLanguages: One of your choice\nEquipment: A small woven basket, a bundle of dried wheat, a vial of golden honey, common clothes, and 10 gold\nFeature: Harvest’s Grace\nYour connection to the bounty of the land grants you unique benefits:\n\nAutumn’s Nourishment: During a short or long rest, you can produce a small portion of food (such as bread, fruit, or roasted nuts) that provides an additional 1d4 temporary hit points to up to 6 creatures who eat it. These temporary hit points last until the next long rest. You can do this once per long rest.\n\nBountiful Growth: When you use an ability, spell, or item that restores hit points to a creature, the healing is increased by your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1).\n\nHarvest’s Rejuvenation: When rolling Hit Dice during a short rest, you and allies within 10 feet of you reroll 1s on Hit Dice.",

  "```[Summary Continued: You decide to rob an old woman named Milda who lives on the outskirts of the village, demanding her valuables while brandishing weapons. Shocked and terrified, she initially refuses, but eventually hands over 10 gold pieces and a tarnished silver necklace. Sensing that she might be hiding more valuable items, one of your party members notices Milda's nervous behavior. In a fit of rage or paranoia, you suddenly stab her, causing her to collapse lifelessly against the wall. After frantically searching her body and finding additional gold pieces, you break open a locked box under her bed and discover a carved wooden idol, a vial of strange liquid, and an old parchment with cult rituals scrawled upon it. As you discuss what these items might mean, footsteps approach outside the cottage and someone knocks on the door. You realize that Milda may have been a member of the cult all along, justifying your brutal actions in hindsight.]```",
