The locals whisper tales of an ancient artifact said to be hidden somewhere within the labyrinthine caves beneath the town. You've heard that whoever claims it will gain immense power.",

Seek out the town's most renowned scholar, rumored to have a map leading to the hidden caves.\n        3. Hire a group of hardened adventurers who claim they've been there before and can guide you through safely.",

            "1. \u2705 The hermit, sensing your genuine interest in uncovering truth, reveals that the artifact is actually a cursed idol which brings doom upon those who possess it. With this knowledge, you decide not to pursue the artifact further.",
            "2. \u274c The scholar, realizing your intentions, refuses to share any information about the artifact, fearing its power could fall into wrong hands.",
            "3. \u2705 The adventurers agree to guide you through the caves on one condition - that you help them retrieve an item of equal value from a nearby bandit camp. You successfully complete this quest and gain their trust, leading to a successful retrieval of the artifact."
